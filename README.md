This is a tip calculator based in JavaScript. Using the calcTip function, a user inputs a total bill amount and the function outputs a 15% tip for bills between $50 and $300, and a 20% tip otherwise. A matrix was also created using two data sets to determine the tip amount and total check amount after tip had been applied.
